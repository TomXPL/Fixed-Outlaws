## List of changes to DeCiv Redux's base 14 factions:

#### Atlas
- They are given a Mountain start bias and are now forbidden from building Enslaved units, Prison Camps and Work Camps.
- Their number of starting techs is reduced to one - Electronics - and they no longer have the nonsensical and unnecessary double Production speed towards Electrostatic Generators.
- Additionally, the free Great Scientist from their UA has been pushed back from Secrets of the Past to Education. Though they no longer have a starting Science penalty.
- Atlas Refuge no longer has a Scientist slot, but adds 80 City HP (up from 40) and 1 base point of Science.
- Survey Center now adds +3 Science, +1 Culture, and increases to +8 Science, +3 Culture at Flight.

  - Kruger Line (standalone national wonder, unlocks at Railroads, requires Factories in every city, consumes Power, adds +3 Culture to the capital, +1 Production to tiles with Railroads and +1 Water per Trade Route)
  - Miracle Metal Mill (replaces Plastics Factory, requires the city to own a Factory and Electrostatic Generator and be working a Metal or Aluminum tile, adds +1 Production to Metal tiles, +2 to Aluminum tiles, and +10% to the city's total Production yields)
- TODO: Add at least one new UU and one more UB based on the source material

#### Blackwarden
- They now start with Trade and Currency instead of Construction and Machinery, and are no longer a Slaver faction.
- Board of Directors adds +2 Water/Science to Personnel Offices (was previously just +1 Water) and enables units to farm Water in combat equal to 10% of the damage they deal to enemy units.
- Operations Center now costs 150 Production.
- Personnel Offices now cost 160 Production and no longer gain bonuses from owning Slaves. However, they gain an Administrator and Merchant slot, reduce tile purchase costs by 25%, and add a +10% Production boost for Personnel units.
- Resource Management Servers have a harsher limit (2 vs. base scenario's 5, but all Monopoly policy buildings have this limit now) and no longer boost city growth or provide Slaves, but to compensate, they give +10% Water to the two cities that can own one.

#### Children of Rust
- They no longer start with Redomestication, and the Faith bonus only applies with *unimproved* Ruins tiles.
- The Longhouse wonder is replaced with First Kiva, which adds +40 more City HP (at the cost of losing the measly +1 to City Strength) and a bonus Pantheon belief upon founding their religion. However, it does not generate any Faith on its own until a Pantheon has been founded, and it gives their new Food Store replacement instead of a Salvage Yard.
- Salvage Yards no longer add Production to Scrap resources; they regain the normal Forge's Production bonus towards Land units.
- Communes are no longer available at the start of the game and no longer reduce tile cost purchase or have any base yields without access to Power. Also, they cost 120 Production (up from 40). However, they add +2 Food with access to Power.

- War Council's Production boost only applies to Armor units. It now adds a 5% Unhappiness reduction in all cities, but the player has to be at war for it to apply.

- New UBs:
  - Ignitor's Tower (new Town Hall replacement, retains the 75% boost to Worker training speed but adds 80 City HP instead of 20% total Food, +2 Production with extra Slaves instead of +2 Food, and +1 Culture/Faith with Books access)
  - Fortified Aquifer (replaces Water Storage, +5 City Strength, +50 City HP, +1 Food/Water to worked Mountain tiles)

They also add +1 Food to active Farmers in the city and +1 Culture to worked Narcotics farm tiles. Because of the Slave consumption requirement, they're 30% cheaper to build than standard Greenhouses.

Also, it no longer gives a free Compound Mixer to the capital and gives their new Food Store replacement instead.
- Standard Refineries gain +1 to their respective yields compared to the base scenario, adjacency bonuses (+1 Production when next to strategic resources, +1 of the respective yield when next to their corresponding GI), and scaling yields, receiving +1 of their respective base yield at Laboratory and another +1 at Advanced Materials. VX Refinery now provides Food instead of Faith, but is not considered a Food source improvement.
- Crystal Refineries have their base yields doubled to +4 Science, +2 Water, but have their adjacency bonuses reduced to +2 Science, +1 Water with 3 or less adjacent Refineries, +4 Science, +2 Water with 4 or more. They gain +2 Production if built atop Coal or Oil resources.

  - Advanced Chemical Refinery (standalone, boosts Refinery yields by 50% in that city and gives Purge Robots access to Chemical Weapons, but requires building the Chemical Weapons Laboratory and consumes both Coal and Power)
