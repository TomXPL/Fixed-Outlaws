# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion + rebalance mod for DeCiv Redux.

## Changes applied to the base scenario

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but they give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for the "barb camps trigger ruins bonuses" concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased.

- As a screw you to the AI's primitive sanity checks, the minimum allowed distance between cities has been increased.

- Pantheons require twice as much Faith to found, but do not increase in cost with each Pantheon founded; every faction present in a game can now found its own religion; and passive religion spread is 50% weaker than in the base scenario.

- Deseret Nation is now a playable faction.

- Many units, buildings, wonders, promotions, beliefs, tile improvements, and ruins bonuses from the base scenario have been either buffed or nerfed, or in the worst-case scenario removed outright. In addition, the social policies have been overhauled. Check the Rebalance Log.md file for a comprehensive list of adjustments.

## Other features

- Two new victory conditions, restoring the "proper" Domination and Science victories.

- Three new factions:
  - Camelot Foundation, a constitutional republic arising from what's left of Wales, England and Brittany.
  - Crimson Line, a faction of hardliner Communists who took shelter from the Cataclysm inside the Moscow Metro and now seek to reunite the Soviet Union by force.
  - The Harbingers, the remnants of an evil Mega-Corp who are now trying to atone for their previous practices...or are they?

- Eight new city-states: Calico (Labor), Carbon (Farming), Defiance (Weapons), Hockeytown (Culture), Issaquah Nation (Prayer, replacing Deseret in that slot), Izumrydniy Gorod (Research), The Pax (Research), and Venice Beach (Trading).

- New units:
  - Barbarian: Suicider + Killdozer
  - City-States: State Guard
  - Civilian: Great Admiral (Rekmod implementation) + Seastead Vessel
  - Collectivism policy: Stalker (yes, the very same Stalker from Roadside Picnic and everything it inspired)
  - Military support: Wandering Doctor + Mobile Clinic
  - Naturalism policy: Eco-Terrorist
  - Scouting: Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, Expeditionary Force
  - Hero units (only 1 allowed per Civ): Hero of the Wastes, only available as a random camp reward

- New buildings: Alternet Cafe, Coastal Defenses, Condenser Cooler, Contraband Disposal Site, Defense Directorate (City-States only), Earth Clinic (Naturalism only), Earthscraper (Collectivism only), Ethanol Station, Food Processing Plant, Interpretative Center, Jeweler, Navy Shipyard (Rediscovery only), Sanctuary, Sociopolitical Institute, Tidal Array, and Workers' Facility (Collectivism only).

- New world wonder: Statue of Remembrance.

- New national wonders:
  - Homeland Defense / Wasteland Surveillance / Raider Suppression Initiatives, each locked behind a starting policy and designed to help each faction survive the early-game.
  - National Reservoir System, the mod's equivalent to BNW's East India Company.
  - Oceanological Center, boosting the Science output and Happiness of coastal cities for factions that have adopted the new Rediscovery policy.
  - Naval War College, the naval counterpart to the Military Academy, but cannot exist in the same city as the Military Academy.
  - Earthscraper Project, unlocking a powerful late-game building for Collectivist factions.
  - Microwave Power Satellite, a late-game Power building for desert cities that also improves Solar collectors.

- New tile improvements:
  - Artificial atoll and Floating Settlement, unlocked at Ocean Remediation and built exclusively by the Seastead Vessel.
  - Drydock, the Great Admiral's Great Improvement.
  - Preservator, borrowed from Bamboolord's expansion mods, currently exclusive to The Pax.
  - Supply Complex, the Great Merchant's new Great Improvement. No longer do Great Administrators and Great Merchants share a Great Improvement.

- All 14 factions in the base scenario have had their unique ability and/or one or more of their unique components adjusted. Several of those factions have received at least one new unique component. Check the Faction Adjustments.md file for more details.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization.

- Several new ruins bonuses with each ruins effect now being weighted, along with buffs to some of the base scenario's bonuses.

- And more is planned for the future; check the ToDoList.md file for some of these things.
